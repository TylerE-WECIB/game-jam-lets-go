    gilgamEsh was mighty
But also very haughty
The gods drew wary
Making eNKidu, a bIt scary
Nothing a seven Day fight coUldn’t fix
Because they realize their personalities mix
Searching for immortality
But instead finding fatality
There was grief and sorrow
0010
Gilgamesh still searching, but instead finding aN empty burrow
Man can’t beat Death
But they can still take a breath
-TO GILGAMESH
